- the difference between `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short` are the number of underlying bits and therefore the range of values they can hold
- the difference between an unsigned and signed type if that signed is all real numbers, while unsigned is only positive values
- the difference between `float` and `double` is the underlying number of bits and therefore the precision
