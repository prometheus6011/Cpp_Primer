`int`, `long long`, and `short` differ in the number of bits that are used to represent the types and therefore affect the ranges of values that can be stored in them

unsigned and signed types differ in the values they can hold
- unsigned types range from all values greater than or equal to 0
- signed types range from negative and positive values

the difference between a `float` and a `double`, is the number of bits used to represent them, and therefore the precision they hold
