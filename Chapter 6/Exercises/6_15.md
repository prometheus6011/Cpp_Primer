```cpp
// returns the index of the first occurence of c in s
// the reference parameter occurs counts how often c occurs

string::size_type find_char(const string &s, char c, string::size_type occurs)
{
	auto ret = s.size();
	occurs = 0;
	for (decltype(ret) i = 0; i != s.size(); ++i) {
		if (s[i] == c) {
			if (ret == s.size())
				ret = i;
			++occurs;
		}
	}

	return ret;
}
```
- s is type `const string&`, we do this because `s` can be quite long as their is a performance benefit, it is `const` because we are not changing the string itself
- c is a value since it is small and is not going to be changed
- `occurs` is a reference and is not const because we want to use this memory location as a return value
