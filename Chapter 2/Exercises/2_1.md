- the differences between `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short` is the number of underlying bits and therefore the ranges of integers that they can each hold
- the difference between `unsigned` and `signed` type is that `signed` can hold all negative, positive values, whereas `unsigned` only hold values from 0 to positive numbers
- the difference between a `float` and a `double` is the number of underlying bits and therefore the floating point precision they hold
